        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>  
          This project focuses on the conversion of conventional ICE sports bikes into electric sports bikes, or referred to as E-Bike in this report. 
          The primary objective is to design a new chassis and fairing system that accommodates the EV powertrain specified by our industry partner, Red Dot Mobility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The redesigned chassis is engineered to integrate key electronic components such as the motor, controller, and battery pack, while optimising structural integrity. 
          Building upon the chassis foundation, subsequent design phase explores the development of the fairing system with aerodynamics in mind.
        </p>  
        <p>
        This project, undertaken over two academic semesters by a team of three mechanical engineering students, aims to employ FEA and CFD to validate the structural and aerodynamic performance of the E-Bike design.

        <h2> 1. Objective & Scope </h2>
        <p>
          This project addresses the challenge of mechanically realising the conversion of an existing 650cc Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) sports bike to electric drive using a fixed powertrain from Red Dot Mobility. 
          The specification of the powertrain, which includes motor, controller and battery, establishes a fixed set of geometric, thermal, and load-bearing constraints. 
          Within these parameters, the project focuses on the structural and aerodynamic redesign necessary to integrate these components effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Context of Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Global adoption of electric two-wheelers is accelerating with market expectations to reach US$150.3 billion by 2034, driven by policy shifts toward low-emission transport (Yahoo, 2025). 
          Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 similarly targets a fully cleaner-energy vehicle fleet by 2040 (Land Transport Authority, 2025). 
          Despite this momentum, the local electric motorcycle sector remains small and segmented.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the premium end of Singapore’s electric motorcycle market, Energica is available through a sole distributor, Ifyni Pte Ltd, and Zero Motorcycles is represented exclusively by Mah Pte Ltd (Ifyni, 2025; Mah, 2025). 
          These arrangements often lead to limited availability and high price points, positioning both brands as niche products for affluent enthusiasts. Meanwhile, local manufacturers such as Scorpio Electric and ION Mobility target commuters to mid-performance segments, focusing on everyday city use rather than the sporty, high-performance category.
          This leaves a clear gap in the local market: riders who want a sporty electric motorcycle face premium prices and limited supply at the top end, while commuter models fall short on performance and feel. 
          Working with Red Dot Mobility, our project addresses this middle space by targeting an electric sports bike that delivers performance and handling at a reachable price, with reliable local support in Singapore.

          This section provides a summary of our evaluation and decision on whether each major component should be retained or redesigned for the electric conversion. 
          The assessment in <i>Table 2.1</i> considers design constraints, manufacturability, and ease of sourcing.

        <h2>3. Concept Development</h2>
        <p>
          The subsystem review in the earlier section concluded that redesign efforts are necessary only for the chassis and fairing assemblies. 
          In this section, we will detail the chassis and fairing concept exploration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-3-header-1">
        <h3>3.1 Chassis Concept Exploration</h3>  
        <p>
          The concept evaluation of the structure and material of chassis can be seen in <i>Table 3.1</i>
        </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/chassis_conceptselection.png"
          subtitle="Table 3.1: Chassis Structure and Material concept selection"></image-component>
        <p> 
          The trellis frame is selected for its exemplary balance of structural rigidity, manufacturability, and cost-effectiveness, particularly suited to the unique requirements of electric motorcycle applications (Kulkarni, C., & Kanthale, V. S., 2024). 
          This frame can be fabricated using straightforward tube welding processes that minimise production costs and complexity. 
          The triangulated layout endows the chassis with outstanding torsional stiffness, which is essential for dynamic performance and safety, and the structure’s geometry can be systematically refined using iterative FEA to achieve optimal stress distribution and weight reduction (Kumar. et.al., 2018). 
          Moreover, the open design of the trellis frame enables modular mounting and secure integration of core components such as the motor, battery, and controller, thereby enhancing flexibility for maintenance or system upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aluminium is selected for the electric bike frame due to its combination of low weight, high corrosion resistance, and cost-effectiveness, which directly improve energy efficiency, riding range, and durability in daily use. 
          Its fabrication processes are well understood and enable modular integration of batteries and electronic systems, while the material’s rigidity ensures responsive handling and long-term structural safety (Ching Pang, G., & Weng Chun, T., 2023).
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-3-header-2">
        <h3>3.2 Fairing Concept Exploration</h3>
        <p>
          The concept evaluation of the structure and material of fairing can be seen in <i>Table 3.2</i>
        </p>  
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/fairing_conceptselection.png"
          subtitle="Table 3.2: Fairing Structure and Material concept selection"></image-component>
        <p>
          A full fairing is selected for its exceptional aerodynamic performance,which is vital for maximising efficiency and extending range in electric motorcycles (Martínez Reategui, C. et al., 2025), alongside its ability to provide comprehensive weather protection and improved rider comfort.
          While it involves higher manufacturing complexity and cost, the gains in energy savings and overall riding experience justify its adoption in high-performance electric mobility applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fibreglass is selected as the fairing material due to its excellent balance of strength and low weight, ease of manufacturing using low-cost tooling, aerodynamic smoothness, and superior repairability compared to plastics and carbon fibre.
          Moreover, it is affordable and supports iterative prototyping (Ferdaus, F. et al., 2021).

        <h3>3.1 Concept Selection</h3>
        <p>
          The design space for the chassis and fairing was systematically investigated using a Morphological Matrix in <i>Figure 3.3</i>. 
          By mapping and combining functional alternatives, the selected solution (shown in blue) reflects a thorough evaluation of viable configurations.

        <h2>4. Prototypes </h2>
        <p>In this section, we will explore the different prototypes created through our development process.</p>
        <div id="sub-section-4-header-1">
        <h3>Chassis Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          To develop the initial chassis prototypes, the original ICE sports bike’s CAD model was used as the geometric baseline, with critical dimensions confirmed against the donor bike during our workshop session at Red Dot Mobility. These measurements established the swingarm pivot, rear damper mount, and front fork mount as the fixed anchor points of the vehicle. Because these interfaces are retained, the overall geometry—including wheelbase, rake, and trail—remains unchanged, preserving the motorcycle’s validated handling characteristics and dynamic performance. 
        </p>
        <p>   
          Accordingly, the chassis was redesigned within these constraints to balance packaging efficiency, manufacturability and structural support for the electric powertrain. 
          Our 3 chassis design prototypes can be seen in <i>Figure 4.1</i>.
        </p>
         <image-component tag="image" source="assets/chassis_prototypes.png"
          subtitle="Table 4.1: Chassis Design Prototypes"></image-component>
        <p>
          Using the Weighted Decision Matrix, we compared the 3 chassis design prototypes across 5 different criterias as seen in <i>Table 4.2</i>.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/pugh_matrixnew1.png"
          subtitle="Table 4.2: Weighted Decision Matrix: Chassis Design Prototypes"></image-component>
        <p>
        <p>
          Prototype 1 was selected for further development as it attained the highest overall weighted score, performing strongly in battery space, weight, fabrication ease, and cost. 
          Although its structural rigidity is comparatively lower, this shortcoming is recognised and will be addressed through targeted refinement and iterative design in subsequent stages.
        </p>
        <div id="sub-section-4-header-2">
        <h3> Iteration Process </h3>
        <p>
          Our iteration process for our selected design chassis, and our initial prototype of fairing can be seen in <i>Table 4.3</i>. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/chassis_iterations.png"
          subtitle="Table 4.3: Iteration Process for Chassis and Fairing"></image-component>
        
        <p>
          After positioning the specified major components—motor, motor controller, and radiator—the remaining space for remaining components can be seen in <i>Figure 4.1</i> (outlined in red). 
          Approximating the battery enclosure as a rectangular prism gives maximum dimensions of 400 × 240 × 490 mm, or 47 L. Using the specified EP6575175VVP pouch-cell class, this space is expected to support approximately 10–12 kWh of usable energy. This remains a preliminary estimate that will be refined once enclosure structures are finalised in Semester 2.
        </p>
         <p>
          In market context, a 10–12 kWh pack places the converted motorcycle above local commuter-class electric models such as the Scorpio Electric X1 and ION Mobility M1-S, 4–6 kWh, but below premium electric sports motorcycles such as the Zero SR/F and Energica Ego+, 17–21 kWh (Scorpio, 2025; Ion Mobility 2025; Zero, 2025; Energica, 2025). 
          The partner-supplied EMRAX 228 motor—a compact axial-flux PMSM rated up to 124 kW and 220 Nm—indicates that a mid-capacity pack within this range remains mechanically and thermally feasible for the intended performance envelope.
          These values serve as a work-in-progress basis for structural integration and will be updated as detailed design progresses.

        <h2>5. Testing & Analysis </h2>
        <p>This section explores our testing and analysis process regarding the chassis design using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on Solidworks.</p>
      <div id="sub-section-5-header-1"></div>
        <h3>5.1 Load Cases </h3>
        <p>
          To evaluate the structural behaviour of the redesigned chassis under representative operating conditions, 3 standard static-equivalent load cases were selected: static loading, 1 g braking, and 3 g bump, as seen in <i>Table 5.1</i>. 
          These cases are widely used in early-stage motorcycle chassis assessment to approximate gravitational, longitudinal, and vertical impact loads in a controlled modelling environment (Cossalter, 2006).
        </p>
         <image-component tag="image" source="assets/loadcases.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.1: Selected 3 Load Cases "></image-component>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-2"></div>
        <h3>5.2 FEA Methodology </h3>
        <p>
          Our objective is to ensure the redesigned chassis meets accepted safety-factor targets for preliminary structural design, typically around 2–3 for nominal loads (static vertical load and 1 g braking) and at least 1.0 for worst-case peak events (3 g bump), consistent with established mechanical design guidelines (Budynas et. al., 2001). 
        </p>
        <p>  
          The implementation of the 3 load cases using our Chassis Iteration 3 design for FEA analysis can be seen in <i>Table 5.2</i>. This baseline evaluation provides the reference from which further refinements will be introduced in later iterations of the chassis design.

          <h3>FEA Modelling Assumptions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li> 
              <p>No residual welding distortion or temperature effects</p>
              The frame is modelled with nominal geometry, without weld-induced residual stresses or thermal loads. 
              Welds typically retain locked-in stresses that shift local stress fields and influence stiffness and fatigue (TWI Global, Residual Stress FAQ). 
              Thermo-mechanical weld modelling is beyond early sizing and can be added later if required.
            </li>
            <li> 
              <p>Fork, swingarm, and damper treated as rigid attachments</p>
              Interfaces at the headstock, swingarm pivot, and suspension mounts are idealised as rigid to isolate the frame’s structural stiffness. 
              Physical torsion and bending tests similarly use stiff fixtures (Boccioni, 2005). 
              The damper is assumed bottomed out and effectively rigid, representing a worst-case condition (Öhlins, 2006).
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dynamic events approximated as equivalent static loads</p>
              Bump and braking cases are dynamic, but for early design they are represented using peak static equivalents of 3 g and 1 g respectively. 
              This quasi-static simplification is widely used in preliminary chassis designs. 
              A quasi-static simplification treats inherently dynamic events, such as bumps or braking, as peak static loads so that their worst-case structural effects can be evaluated without modelling time-dependent behaviour (Cossalter, 2006).
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h3>5.3 FEA - Material Selection </h3>
        This subsection explores the impact of chassis material, and our material choice of steel justification.
        <h3>Aluminium (Yield Strength: 5.51x10<sup>7</sup>Pa)</h3>
          <p>
          Using the 3 load cases, we conducted FEA analysis on the Chassis Iteration 3 design with aluminium material as seen in <i>Table 5.3</i>.
          </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/aluminium_plots.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.3: Stress Plot in 3 Load Cases for Chassis Iteration 3 (Aluminium) "></image-component>
          <p></p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/aluminium_results.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.4: Chassis Iteration 3 (Aluminium) FEA results "></image-component>

          <p>
            As seen in <i>Table 5.4</i>, the FoS for aluminium chassis is undesirable with all of them being less than 0.1 showing significant yielding even in the static simulation. 
            The safety factor plot from the 3G bump case shows many portions of the base chassis experiencing stresses more than yield strength hence yielding. 
            Thus, another material is considered since there is too much yielding. 
          </p>

        <h3>Steel (Yield Strength: 4.60x10<sup>8</sup>Pa)</h3>
        <p>
          Using the 3 load cases, we conducted FEA analysis on the Chassis Iteration 3 design with steel material as seen in <i>Table 5.5</i>.

        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/steel_cases.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.5: Stress Plot in 3 Load Cases for Chassis Iteration 3 (Aluminium)"></image-component>

          <p></p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/steel_results.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.6: Chassis Iteration 3 (Aluminium) FEA results"></image-component>
          <p>
            As seen in <i>Table 5.6</i>, the static case achieves a FoS of 1.64 so the steel chassis remains elastic under its own weight. 
            Under 1 g braking and 3 g bump the safety factor is below 1 and indicates local yielding concentrated at highly loaded joints such as the fork and swingarm mounts, thus, helping us narrow our area of focus for future iterations.
          </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Using the 3 g bump load case, we compare the FoS plot of Chassis Iteration 3 using aluminium and steel respectively in <i>Figure 5.7</i> to assess the influence of material choice.</p>
         <image-component tag="image" source="assets/material_summary.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.7: Almunium vs Steel: FoS Plot for 3 g Bump load case"></image-component>

          <p>
            Side-by-side comparison of the FoS plots shows that the steel chassis is significantly more tolerant than the aluminium version. 
            With steel, regions where the FoS drops below 1 are largely confined to the fork mount and swingarm pivot, whereas in aluminium almost the entire frame approaches or exceeds yield. 
            Steel is therefore adopted for subsequent work, and the refinement effort is focused on improving the fork connection and swingarm mount regions.
          </p>
          <p>  
            After switching to steel, further iterations were evaluated primarily under the most severe load case, the 3 g vertical bump. 
            If the chassis can sustain this enveloping condition with a FoS greater than 1, the lower-magnitude static and 1 g braking loads will be satisfied with additional margin. 
            A 3 g bump load is widely used in early vehicle chassis design as a representative worst case for pothole or curb impacts, so demonstrating FoS > 1 at 3 g provides confidence that the frame can withstand realistic peak events for static sizing checks (Government of South Australia Department for Infrastructure and Transport, 2024).
          </p>

        <h3>5.4 FEA - Chassis Iteration Process </h3>
        <p>This subsection explores our FEA-guided iteration process of our chassis design. 
          A summary of our key takeaways can be seen in <i>Table 5.8</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, the addition of the beams improved the strength of the chassis and we will continue the iteration process until a desirable FoS (>1) for the 3 g Bump load case is achieved.
        </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/chassis_feaiterations.png"
            subtitle="Table 5.8: FEA-guided chassis design improvements "></image-component>
          <p>After numerous iterations, we finally obtained a desirable chassis design as seen in <i>Figure 5.1.</i></p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/a_finalfea.png"

            subtitle="Table 5.9: Chassis Final Iteration 5 FEA results "></image-component>
          <p>As seen in <i>Table 5.9</i>, FoS have improved significantly after the changes and are all within the acceptable criteria of more than 1thus we could end the iteration process. </p>
      <div id="sub-section-5-header-5"></div>
        <h3>5.5 FEA - Conclusions </h3>
          <p>
            The chassis went through numerous FEA-guided iterations, ranging from minor member adjustments to more substantial changes in triangulation and joint detailing. 
            For clarity, <i>Figure 5.10</i> contrasts the initial Chassis Iteration 3 frame with our latest iteration.
          </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/fea_summary_chassis.png"
          subtitle="Table 5.10: Summary of Chassis Iterations through FEA Analysis"></image-component>
          <p>
            As additional beams and gusset plates were introduced, the locations of stress hotspots shifted rather than remaining fixed. 
            For example, an initial hotspot at the fork mount moved toward the tip of the newly added member and reduced in magnitude, reflecting improved load sharing. 
            This behaviour is expected in a triangulated chassis, since slender beam members in a truss carry loads primarily through axial tension and compression instead of bending, which increases global stiffness for a given mass and channels forces along efficient load paths; 
            this principle underpins space frame and trellis designs in structural engineering and motorcycle chassis practice (SteelConstruction.info; AISC, 2016). 
            Gusset plates at tube junctions further enlarge the effective load-transfer area and smooth the transition of forces between intersecting members, reducing stress concentrations (Syed, 2011).
          </p> 
          <p>
            By iteratively analysing and refining the frame in this way, non-working or lightly stressed members can be identified and removed, while material is added only where safety factor targets are not met. 
            This keeps the chassis structurally efficient in terms of weight and supports cost-effective manufacture by limiting fabrication to members that provide clear structural benefit. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            Overall, the latest chassis iteration achieves a stiffer and more structurally efficient chassis that meets the targeted safety factors with only minimal, well-targeted additions of material.
          </p>

        <h2>6. Limitation and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          As this report represents the interim stage of the project, several aspects of the design remain under development. 
          The current work has focused on establishing the structural basis of the chassis through material selection and static FEA, which is necessary before dependent subsystems—such as the fairing, mounting features, and detailed packaging—can be advanced. 
          The following subsections outline the principal limitations identified to date and the corresponding strategies planned to address them in the next phase of the project.
        </p>
      <div id="sub-section-6-header-1">
        <h3>6.1 Chassis</h3>
        <p>
          The current tubular chassis design, while structurally validated, requires multiple welding jigs to hold tubes at precise angles. 
          To reduce manufacturing cost and complexity, the design will adopt simplified, sequentially assembled tube preforms that can be laid out on a welding table, reducing the need for complex 3D fixtures (Günther et al., 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          Static FEA alone is insufficient for analysis of the chassis, as it assumes ideal geometry, material uniformity, and fixed boundary conditions that overlook weld distortion and dynamic effects. 
          Hence, the manufactured frame will be validated using a strain-gauge rig replicating the static, braking, and bump loads (Nguyen et al., 2018). 
          Measured principal strains will be compared with FEA results, with deviations within 10–20 percent considered acceptable for model correlation. 
          While ISO 4210-6 is a bicycle frame and fork standard, its fixture and load-introduction concepts will be adapted only as methodological guidance for rig design.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2">
        <h3>6.2 Fairing</h3>
        <p>
          The fairing system requires further refinement, as the current design is a minimalist, wrap-around which may not optimise aerodynamic performance or thermal management. 
          Prior studies highlight that fairing geometry directly affects drag, lift, and component cooling (Winski et al, 2022). 
          Consequently, CFD simulations will be undertaken to evaluate airflow distribution and cooling performance, guiding iterative improvements in fairing shape and vent placement.
        </p>

      <div id="section-header-7">
        <h2>7. Project Plan</h2>
          <p>
            At this midpoint of the project, effort has centred on completing the chassis’ structural assessment, including material evaluation and static FEA. 
            Fairing development and detailed component mounting will proceed in the next semester.
          </p>
      <div id="sub-section-7-header-1">
        <h3>7.1 Fulfilment of Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            At this stage, the project has met its key interim deliverables and is on schedule for prototype fabrication next semester. 
            The fit and placement of major components within the chassis have been verified, FEA indicates the frame is structurally sound with a safety factor of at least 1 under the critical 3 g bump case, major components integration has been demonstrated, and the available battery volume falls within the energy range of comparable commercial models. 
            A first-iteration full fairing has also been developed as a close-fitting wrap-around shell that hugs the chassis and major components, yielding a compact frontal area. 
            By keeping the bodywork flush and avoiding unnecessary bulges, this concept is expected to limit drag through a low CdA, the main driver of aerodynamic resistance for motorcycles and bicycles (Cossalter, 2006). 
            Simple weldments are used throughout, supporting small-batch manufacturability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taken together, these results show that the project has effectively fulfilled its interim goals and established a solid foundation for Semester 2. 
            The next phase will focus on adding the mounting designs on chassis before fabrication, completing the detailed design of the fairing, and validating the current simulations. 
            For the chassis, we plan to conduct basic stress–strain measurements using strain gauges to compare measured response against the FEA predictions. 
            For the fairing, we will use CFD to assess the aerodynamic performance and verify that the proposed geometry achieves the intended low-drag behaviour. 
            All of this will be carried out within the practical constraints of a single semester, limited manpower and a finite budget, with effort concentrated on delivering a buildable, testable prototype.
